# 1 Find the union and intersection of two sets.

# d=a.intersection(b)

#Remove all elements from a set that are present in another set.
# a={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
# b={1,2,3,4,5,6}
# c=a-b

#Generate a set of unique numbers from a list with duplicates

# a=[1,1,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,7,8]
# a=set(a)

#Write a program to find the symmetric difference of two sets.

# Count the number of elements in a set.

# Check if a specific element is present in a set.
# c=int(input("enter number"))
